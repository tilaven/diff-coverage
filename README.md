# ⚡🧠️ diff-coverage

Diff-cover, supercharged in Rust 🦀. Get instant, actionable coverage insights at ⚡ blazing speed ⚡ with 
a 🧠️ tiny memory footprint 🧠️. Built for modern CI and massive repos, it turns slow coverage checks into 
fast, reliable feedback you can trust.

## Usage

```shell
diff-coverage coverage.xml --diff-file diff.diff

# Multiple coverage inputs (repeat or comma‑separated)
diff-coverage coverage1.xml coverage2.xml --diff-file diff.diff

# Multiple coverage inputs in a directory
diff-coverage ./coverage/ --diff-file diff.diff

# Fail the build if diff coverage drops below a threshold
diff-coverage ./coverage/ coverage.xml --diff-file diff.diff --fail-under 80

# Output to CI formats
diff-coverage coverage.xml --diff-file diff.diff --output gitlab=diff-cover.json
diff-coverage coverage.xml --diff-file diff.diff --output json=diff-cover.json --output summary
```

Options
- --diff-file <PATH>: diff to analyze
- --fail-under <PERCENT>: minimum acceptable diff coverage
- --missing-coverage <MODE>: how to handle files missing from coverage (uncovered or ignore, default: ignore)
- --output <FORMAT=PATH>: output target(s), repeatable or comma‑separated Formats: cli, summary, gitlab, json (note: cli and summary don’t take a path)
- -h, --help: show help
- -V, --version: show version
